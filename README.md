# AppliedMLProject
The HCDR project's mission is to provide loans to people with little credit history. We want to determine its customer's eligibility for their financial products by determining their risk of default. We evaluate their data and develops a machine learning tool to predict default risk which uses more features than just the traditional credit history.
